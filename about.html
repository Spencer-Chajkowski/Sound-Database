<h1>About my project</h1>
<p>
The Database can currently be accessed at cs.mvnu.edu/classes/csc3032/spechajkowski/sound/
To View information in the database, choose the corresponding field on the main page corresponding to the information you wish to know about. For example: to view microphones in the database the dropdown will take you to a page with a table of microphones. 
To add information to the database, navigate to the “Add Equipment” filed in the main menu. This will navigate you to this page.




Enter your data and then check the corresponding table. The asset number should automatically update. 


To check the tables and to verify what information is there, log in as administrator and check the campus_sound table on phpMyAdmin. 



This documentation will look much different when the database is fully deployed. I did not feel comfortable posting my phpMyAdmin information. I was limited between time and hosting resources to fully develop the final product that will be used by Campus Sound. 


Issues:
I came across several issues while implementing this database. 
•	Php
o	This is my first experience programming in PHP so there was a learning curve for me to implement a front-end of the database that wasn’t in phpMyAdmin. 
•	Hosting
o	I wasn’t quite sure where to host the project, for the purpose of the class I decieded to host it on the CS server but I plan to migrate it to either an AWS web instance (that is paid for by Campus Sound) or to implement it on a campus server.
•	SQL in PHP
o	I was unable to successfully insert data via my PHP website into my database, I am unsure if this is related to my query or my PHP syntax 
o	I attempted to create a login screen page, but because of time restraints I was unable to implement this. 
o	I was not able to search for an Integer via my PHP page, I verified that my query was correct by testing it on phpMyAdmin but every attempt at searching for my asset numbers resulted in an error. 
o	Likewise, my searches for Brand also result in an error despite the SQL being in proper syntax and my PHP being correct to the best of my knowledge. 
•	Data Integrity and Consistency
o	Anyone who finds my url will have access to it until I include a login screen, this means that it is valuable to SQL injections
o	My Asset Numbers are determined by sub-databases and may be inconsistent when inserted, I was unable to test this at the time of submission because I was unable to INSERT from my page.
o	My asset numbering system allows for there to be 100 of each item in a category, so in the event that campus sound had over 100 of an item, the asset system would begin deploying duplicate numbers. For example, a direct-box could have the number 1399 and a mixer could have the asset number 1400 and if 100 direct boxes were documented, then I would have redundant data.
